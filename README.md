### Limitations

The analysis has limitations that include a simplified binary gender classification, hindering a nuanced understanding of diversity. The absence of detailed exit interview data limits insight into specific reasons for attrition. External factors, like market trends, are not considered. Additionally, the static nature of the salary analysis lacks depth, urging a more dynamic approach for a comprehensive understanding of compensation trends.
